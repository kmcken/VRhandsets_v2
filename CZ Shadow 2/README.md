# CZ Shadow 2 Grip Modules for ACEXR Arctus Grip

There are multiple options for the CZ Shadow 2 grip module.

The folder "Grip Modules for Aftermarket Grip Panels" includes STL files for the CZ Shadow 2 that allow you to install your own preferred after market grip panels. The folder "Grip Panels" includes several printable grip panels available for the grip modules designed for aftermarket panels.

The folder "Grip Modules Complete" includes STL files for the CZ Shadow 2 with the grip panels designed into the file. This allows you to print without adding an aftermarket grip panel and includes a larger internal volume in the mag well for added weights.

The CZS2_trigger.STL is designed after the Cajun Gun Works "Old Style" trigger in single action.
