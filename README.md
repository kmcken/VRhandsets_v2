# VRhandsets_v2
Aftermarket handsets for ACEXR V2 handset fire control unit (FCU).

The FCU contains the Quest 2/3 controller mount, trigger, sear, and mag releasure button mechanism.

The STL file for the grip replicates the titled pistol to enable the user to closely match their personal firearm. The FCU is inserted into the grip/handset, and the roll pins from the original handset are reused. The handset folders may include STL files for triggers and/or mag release specific to the firearm model. The handset includes open volume to allow the user to add weights to closely match the real firearm weight. It is recommended to use lead or tungsten shot and seal the weights into the grip and/or muzzle portion of the handset.

The CZ trigger is currently in BETA. Any and all feedback is welcome.

The grips were designed by Ben49 on thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2190338)
