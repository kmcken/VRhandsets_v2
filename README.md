# VRhandsets_v2
Aftermarket handsets for ACEXR V2 handset fire control unit (FCU).

The FCU contains the Quest 2/3 controller mount, trigger, sear, and mag releasure button mechanism.

The STL file for the grip replicates the titled pistol to enable the user to closely match their personal firearm. The FCU is inserted into the grip/handset, and the roll pins from the original handset are reused. The handset folders may include STL files for triggers and/or mag release specific to the firearm model.
